# Vanilla WoW Toppings
[An AddOn manager for the classic versions of World of Warcraft]

Vanilla WoW Toppings is an application that gives the user an easy way of installing/uninstalling WoW AddOns. A collection of AddOns is required and can usually be downloaded from the forums of private servers.

The application also includes a simple way of backing up currently installed AddOns and game settings so the user can restore them at a later time.
