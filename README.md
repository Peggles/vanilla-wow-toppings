An AddOn Manager for Vanilla WoW

Vanilla WoW Toppings is an application that gives the user an easy way of installing/uninstalling WoW addons. A collection of AddOns is required and can usually be downloaded from the forums of private servers.

The application also includes an easy way of backing up currently installed AddOns and game settings so the user can restore them at a later time.
